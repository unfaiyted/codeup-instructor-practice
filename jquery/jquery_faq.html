    // INTRO:
    // 1. GO SLOW
    // 2. MISSING WORDS
    // 4. ASK QUESTIONS

    // Ok so first I would start by taking a look at the insturctions.
    // Justin has provided us with a html template for this so we can save some time making this
    //

    // TODO: 1. Copy instructions into the file

    // Create a new file named jquery_faq.html. Commit all changes to GitHub.
    //
    //     In a HTML structure, create a definition list containing 10 FAQs about national parks.
    //
    //     Add a class to all dd elements named invisible.
    //
    //     Create some CSS rules that sets elements with the invisible class to visibility: hidden;.
    //
    // Update the page with jQuery to add a link that toggles the class invisible on and off for all dd elements.
    //
    //     Bonus
    //
    // When any of the dt elements is clicked, the element that was clicked should be highlighted.

    // TODO: 2. Read the instructions

    // TODO: 3. Create HTML Structure

    <!--html>(head>title{Jquery FAQ}+style)+body>(dl>(dt{National Park $}+dd.invisible{Park #$ is amazing.})*10)+script*2-->

    // TODO: 4. Visit the definition list site.

    // TODO: 5. Create full Structure, add ref to jquery.

    <!--script[type=text/javascript src=js/jquery.js]-->

    // TODO: 6.

    // ASK: What type of selector am I going to use?

    // What should we target for the link?
    // what if we target the Definition Title?


    // How would I do that?

    $(document).ready(function() {

        $("button").click(function ()  {
            // Loop over each element and turn off the highlight function
            $('dd').each((index, element) => {
                $(element).toggleClass("invisible")
            })
        })



        /**
         * On Click will toggle next item as visible or invisiable
         */
        $('dt').click(function(event) {

            // Loop over each element and turn off the highlight function
            $('dt').each((index, element) => {
                $(element).removeClass("highlight")
            })

            // add it back to the element that was selected
            $(this).addClass("highlight")


        });

        // / BONUS!!!!!
        // When any of the dt elements is clicked, the element that was clicked should be
        // highlighted.
    });







    // RECAPITATION
    // 1 . Created a document.ready wrapper function
    // 2. We used Jquery to add an Event handler to the page for each of the definition titles
    // BONUS:
    // 3. We also used jquerys each function to turn off all the highlights.
    // 4. We then enabled it for the one we are clicking on.

    // 5. ASK: How would we change this code if we wanted to hide the definitions
    //         when the other one is clicked?

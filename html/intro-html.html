    // Notes

    // Exercises

    // Make sure you have a folder in your computer named codeup-web-exercises if you haven't created one already.

    // TODO: Display the process of me creating the folder


    // Create a new remote repository on GitHub named codeup-web-exercises if you haven't already,
    // this repository will be useful to upload our code to github.com.

    // TODO: go to github

    // TODO: select codeupclassroom
    // https://github.com/CodeupClassroom


    //

    // Create a file named welcome.html file with the structure of a html document so that it that
    // displays the text "Hello, World!".
    const commands = []

    // Finally, commit the changes to your git repository, and push to GitHub.


    // Creating a new Repo:

    // echo "# codeup-web-exercises" >> README.md
    commands.push(`git init`);

    // Initilizes a new git repository at the folders location
    // git add README.md // adds a specific file to the items

    commands.push(` git add . `);

        // origin: is an alias on your system for a particular remote repository.
        // It's not actually a property of that repository.
        // We almost always use origin as its industry standard, if you had more than one repo you pushed this code to
        // you might have multiple differeent remote addresses

    commands.push(` git push -u origin main `);
        // -u sets the upstream location
        // WHERE am I pushing this to, with this you say git push is going to "origin" from the main branch

        // once you've set the git push location above you can push using only git push.
